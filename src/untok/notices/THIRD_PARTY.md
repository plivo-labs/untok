# Source provenance

Original Untok source code is licensed under [Apache-2.0](licenses/Apache-2.0.txt).
The tokenizer models, source-derived inventories and other third-party materials
retain the component-specific terms below. The package's combined license
expression records these separate obligations; it does not relicense every
component under Apache-2.0.

BPE input pins are in `configs/sources.lock.json` and `configs/corpora.lock.json`.
Native input pins are recorded in its generated selection, frozen corpus
manifest and study reports. Build manifests record consumed hashes. This
project does not assert NVIDIA, AI4Bharat or Meta endorsement.

The Python package includes the four native tokenizer bundles and these
upstream license and attribution texts:

- [OpenMDW 1.1](licenses/OpenMDW-1.1.txt), from the [agreement linked by NVIDIA](https://openmdw.ai/license/1-1/).
- [AI4Bharat MIT notice](licenses/IndicBART-MIT.txt), from the [IndicBART repository](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indic-bart/blob/0256f8ed1f73fa2716464f96de137d1fcf692641/LICENSE).
- [Meta notice](licenses/Meta-notice.txt), from [Omnilingual ASR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr/blob/81f51e224ce9e74b02cc2a3eaf21b2d91d743455/LICENSE), and the [Apache 2.0 license](licenses/Apache-2.0.txt).
- [Unicode License V3](licenses/Unicode-3.0.txt), from [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt).

The `original` profile contains a byte-identical copy of NVIDIA's embedded
13,087-entry SentencePiece tokenizer, accompanied by Untok's wrapper metadata.
The `full` profile preserves that original prefix and adds the selected Indic
vocabulary. The `latin` and `latin-indic` profiles are derived script subsets
with compact IDs and explicit source row maps. All retain the original
SentencePiece normalizer. The source code's Apache license does not replace
the terms for these model/data materials.

The NVIDIA-derived tokenizer materials remain subject to OpenMDW 1.1.
Redistributions must include that agreement and applicable original copyright
and origin notices. Keep this file and the accompanying `licenses/` directory
with standalone tokenizer exports. Other included materials retain the terms
listed above; NVIDIA's license does not replace those terms.
The migration command does not embed these sidecars in `.nemo` checkpoints;
include them separately when redistributing a migrated checkpoint.

In the packaged selection metadata, `study/` replaces the original study
workspace prefix. Source content hashes, piece selections, scores and tokenizer
models are unchanged; the metadata has its own updated integrity hash.

No acoustic checkpoint weights or third-party corpus text are included here.
The historical selected 190-character Latin inventory remains in the source
study metadata but is not imported as added vocabulary in the current profiles.
No universal Unicode fallback is provided. The IndicConformer donor normalizers are not imported into
the final tokenizer. The BPE variant retains the published JSON normalizer;
the native Unigram variant retains the embedded SentencePiece normalizer.

See [native corpus preparation](docs/native-unigram-data.md) for sampling,
split checks, source-specific annotation cleanup and exclusions. Corpus text
is not included in tokenizer bundles. Vaani was downloaded for inspection
but excluded from native fitting because its lexical extraction policy is
unresolved. IN22-Conv was unavailable to the supplied account and is excluded.

Native script subset profiles use the generated Unicode 17.0.0 table in
`src/untok/_bundle_script_ranges.py`. The table includes the Unicode License V3
notice and ships as a Python module with the wheel. Regenerate it with
`scripts/generate_bundle_script_ranges.py`; its inputs must match these hashes:

| Unicode 17 input | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Scripts.txt | `9f5e50d3abaee7d6ce09480f325c706f485ae3240912527e651954d2d6b035bf` |
| ScriptExtensions.txt | `ec2107e58825a1586acee8e0911ce18260394ac8b87e535ca325f1ccbeb06bc6` |
| PropertyValueAliases.txt | `64e9a5f76f7a1e8b5a47d6a1f9a26522a251208f5276bdfa1559dac7cf2e827a` |
| UnicodeData.txt | `2e1efc1dcb59c575eedf5ccae60f95229f706ee6d031835247d843c11d96470c` |

The files are published in the [Unicode 17 UCD directory](https://www.unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/).
The policy retains Common punctuation, but checks restricted Script_Extensions
for other Common and Inherited characters. It does not classify by Unicode
block or by a character's name.
